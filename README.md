wiki-hop
========

This is the source code for [wiki-hop.org](http://wiki-hop.org/),
an experimentation with the free tier of Google App engine
and search algorithms using the Wikipedia dataset.

## warning
Wiki-hop has not been updated since its launch many years ago.
This source may be incomplete, may not compile, be poorly documented,
or be functionally different than what is currently
hosted at wiki-hop.

## todo
 * Convert to C and C++ libraries
 * Extend bi-directional search to 'n-directional' search
 * New front-end
 * Automatic updates
 * Categorize and utilize all nodes
